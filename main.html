    <p class="ppcolor">1)Book</p>
    <p>Books are the best and have all kinds of solutions. Books were developed from the earnest of writing. It was seen for the first time in Egypt, where a book was made with the help of a wooden cover and the pages were made up of animal skin. It was also Johannes Gutenberg a prominent name in the history for making books with the help of mechanical printing press, approx. in 1450.

        In the old days, books were created to store information. People use to pass knowledge from one generation to another with the help of books. Bible, Gita, and Quran are some of the examples. Even it was only with the help of books we know our history. Many writers wrote various stories about different kings and their dynasties.A book is a medium of spreading knowledge. They are also the best medium of studies. As some books are just for entertainment, some are to learn, some should be applied in our lives. The motives of different books are different. Francis Bacon has very well described books in his essay ‘Of Studies’. He said -

        “Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend”.
        
        We should read all types of books but apply only what we need. This is because we are taught various subjects in our schools.
        
        Printing with the help of blocks was first seen in China in 220 AD. Whereas it was 1040 AD when printing became possible with the help of technology. After the development of printing technology, it became easy to print books. Nowadays books are also available online in the form of e-books.
        
        Some people feel tough to carry books; they can easily read e-books on their phones. Books contain good thoughts and knowledge. The more you read them the wiser you grow. Make books your best friend and they will never disappoint you.</p>
        <p class="ppcolor">2)HISTORY OF Books</p>
        <p>The history of the books became an acknowledged academic discipline in the 1980s, Contributors to the discipline include specialists from the fields of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology, palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history. Its key purpose is to demonstrate that the book as an object, not just the text contained within it, is a conduit of interaction between readers and words.

            Prior to the evolution of the printing press, made famous by the Gutenberg Bible, each text was a unique hand crafted article, personalized through the design features incorporated by the scribe, owner, bookbinder and illustrator.[1] Analysis of each component part of the book reveals its purpose, where and how it was kept, who read it, ideological and religious beliefs of the period and whether readers interacted with the text within. Even a lack of evidence of this nature leaves valuable clues about the nature of that particular book.</p>
